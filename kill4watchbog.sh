# kill4watchbog
#
# I heard about watchbog at the SXSW Gaming Expo
# from a genteleman who had just spent his weekend
# cleaning it out of their data center. It doesn't
# have to be that hard to get rid of that code.
# Install the system updates in this script, or
# set this script as executable and it run it.
#
# The places it puts itself, queries to, and
# downloads from are now configured to block it
# according to the best info I can find today
# about watchbog and it should now be blocked
# from replication. I haven't been infected, but
# I have tested that the script accomplishes
# what I intended on my own linux servers.

#!/bin/bash
# run this command, without the quotes
#  "while true ; do killall watchbog ; done"
# prior to running this script
# so that that process is already killed
